# Funnyplaying Burnmaster Firmware

- Thanks to [Makho for providing this](https://youtu.be/v29IgckBxb8)


Based on Sanni's [cartreader](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader) firmware


### Notes:

This repository is setup to auto-build the firmware when a commit is made, builds can be found under the [Actions tab](https://github.com/HDR/Burnmaster-Firmware/actions), this makes it really easy to fork this repository and make your own changes without having to download Segger Embedded Studio
